Iframe Preserver plugin allows you to easily embed any iframe and preserves your embedded iframes by utilizing WordPress' Custom Fields.


== Description ==
		
The Iframe Preserver plugin allows you to easily embed an iframe in a page or post and preserves your embedded iframes by allowing use of WordPress' Custom Fields. This keeps the WordPress editor from stripping out the iframe in Visual editing mode. You do not need to do any editing or modification to the shortcode or iframe code. Works for all iframe embeds including YouTube, Vimeo, Scribd and even Real Estate IDXs.  It is an efficent light weight plugin.
			
Just place the shortcode [field name=iframe] in the page or post where you would like the iframe to appear. Then in the Custom Fields section for Name enter "iframe" (less quotes) and for Value paste in the exact iframe code you are provided and wish to display. You can do this in either Visual mode or Text mode, it will not make a difference. Future page or post edits in either mode will also not make a difference.  The iframe embed is preserved.
	
If you cannot find the Custom Fields options in your editing screen, go to the upper right corner and click on "Screen Options" and make sure that Custom Fields is checked to display.


== Installation ==

You can install Iframe Preserver directly from the WordPress admin panel. Visit Plugins > Add New and search for 'Iframe Preserver'. Click to automatically install.  Once installed, activate and Iframe Preserver is functional.

Q - How can I create the iframe HTML code that goes in the Value section of the Custom Fields?

Q - Can I use this plugin to place more than one iframe in a page or post?

A - Yes. As many iframes can be embedded in a page or post as you may want.  Just increment the field name, say from iframe1 to iframe2, iframe3 ... iframeX. For example if you wanted three iframes in the page your short codes could be [field name=iframe1] [field name=iframe2] [field name=iframe3] and then in the Name section of the Custom Fields area you would have one for each short code. So one line would have 
Name  = iframe1
Value = < your iframe code >
and so on as needed.
