Iframe Preserver plugin allows you to easily embed an iframe and preserves your embedded iframes by allowing use of WordPress' Custom Fields. Which keeps TinyMCE from stripping out the iframe in Visual editing mode. You do not need to do any editing or modification to the shortcode or iframe code. Works for all iframe embeds including YouTube, Vimeo, Scribd and even Real Estate IDXs.  It is an efficent light weight plugin.
